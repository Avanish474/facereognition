# facereognition

Step 1--> First we make datadets for our model (by the use of HaarCascade).We store our dataset in a file called face

This file is further divided into train and test sets

Train has two subfiles n1 and n2 .n1 has the face data of me and n2 has the face data of my friend.

Simialarly we do it for Test 

Step 2--> we build model and train it using Vgg16 by applying concepts of Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning
